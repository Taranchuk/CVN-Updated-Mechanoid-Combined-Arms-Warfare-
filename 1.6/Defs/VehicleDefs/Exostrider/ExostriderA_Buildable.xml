		<description>The exostrider is a colossal six legged mech that employs a single large weapon to devistating effect, primarily used as a means to support troops from the back has a small risk of friendly fire if not used carefully \n\nThis version employs an extremely large charge railgun propelling miniscule steel projectiles at such velocity that it penetrates most materials and targets with more than enough energy to continue their trajectory.
\n\n&lt;color=#FFA500&gt;Requires 5 Low Energy Canisters to fire the Railgun.&lt;/color&gt; \n\n&lt;color=#00ddc0&gt;Provides 30 bandwith, has no capacity for advisory crew, powered by mechanoid cells similar to those found in clusters, Provides a command range of 50.&lt;/color&gt; \n\n&lt;color=#FF0000&gt; Hostile Railgun Exostriders will attempt to fire on your colonists from the furthest possible range, spread out and advance or bombard the walker as it lacks any significant anti air during it's lengthy recharge.&lt;/color&gt;</description>
