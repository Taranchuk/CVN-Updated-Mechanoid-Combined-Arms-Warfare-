		<label>Exostrider Disruptor</label>
		<description>The exostrider is a colossal six legged mech that employs a single large weapon to devistating effect, primarily used as a means to support troops from the back has a small risk of friendly fire if not used carefully \n\nThis version employs a large molecular disruptor which causes solid walls to crumble under their own weight and living things to become extremely volatile causing them to explode on death.
\n\n&lt;color=#FFA500&gt;Requires 5 High Energy Canisters to fire the Wave generator.&lt;/color&gt; \n\n&lt;color=#00ddc0&gt;Provides 30 bandwith, has no capacity for advisory crew, powered by mechanoid cells similar to those found in clusters, Provides a command range of 50.&lt;/color&gt; \n\n&lt;color=#FF0000&gt; Hostile Disruptor Exostriders will attempt to breach your walls and cause your defenses to crumble, easily countered by aircraft because while the disruptor can target air units, it fails to do any significant direct damage to mobile units.&lt;/color&gt;</description>
